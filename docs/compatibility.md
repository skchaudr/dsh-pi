# Compatibility matrix

Status meanings:

- **supported** — the Pi-visible behavior maps through the official Pi runtime and has a DSH counterpart.
- **partial** — useful behavior maps, but at least one caller-visible semantic differs.
- **unsupported** — the host refuses or reports the gap; it does not pretend the operation succeeded.

The executable source of truth is [`src/capabilities.ts`](../src/capabilities.ts). Tests ensure every API/event used by the current Pi fixture workspace has an entry in that matrix.

## ExtensionAPI methods

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `registerTool` | partial | Execution, TypeBox validation, strict schema projection (including mutually exclusive literal unions and numeric bounds `minimum`/`maximum`/`exclusiveMinimum`/`minItems`; `$schema` draft markers are dropped), argument preparation, cancellation, sanitized errors, ordered updates, images, concurrency, active sets, and lifecycle-time registration/replacement. Successful text is bounded to 50KB/2000 lines, oversized details are omitted, and images are checked against DSH attachment limits before decoding. Overlapping unions, validation keywords outside DSH's enforced subset, and other unrepresentable schemas fail closed. Pi TUI renderers and DSH live update cards do not. |
| `registerCommand` | partial | Handlers, sanitized unexpected failures, and `ctx.ui.notify` text (returned as the command result) map to DSH command responses. Pi argument completions do not. Dialogs inside commands use the visible UI bridge when a decision path is composed. |
| flags | supported | `registerFlag` / `getFlag` defaults plus configured overrides use Pi's store. |
| active tools/catalog | partial | Active names are filtered and adapted Pi registrations reconcile into DSH. Catalog APIs expose Pi extension tools/commands only, not DSH-native tools, commands, skills, or templates. |
| `sendUserMessage` | supported | Text/images become identified DSH plugin messages; images use the attachment service. |
| `sendMessage` | partial | Every custom entry is durably appended to the projected Pi session (with `display`, `customType`, details) before delivery; workflow messages dedupe by `workflowMessageId` and duplicates are not re-enqueued. Non-waking idle injection, trigger-turn, follow-up, steering, and native next-turn delivery map. Attachment persistence is drained at lifecycle boundaries and delivery is suppressed after disposal begins. |
| `exec` | supported | Uses Pi's own child-process implementation and options. |
| `appendEntry`, session name, labels | partial | Persisted in the projected durable Pi session; not written into DSH's durable event vocabulary. |
| model selection | partial | Provider/model ids update DSH agent options, but only an installed DSH adapter makes that route real. |
| thinking level | partial | Pi-side state only. |
| provider registration | unsupported | A Pi `ProviderConfig` is not a DSH `LlmAdapter`; install/configure `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-pi-ai` instead. |
| shortcuts and Pi renderers | unsupported | DSH has no equivalent keyboard registry, and replayable DSH views cannot run Pi TUI components. |
| extension EventBus | supported | Supplied directly by Pi's official loader. |

## ExtensionContext

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ui` | partial | Text notifications, statuses, and widget clears publish visibly into the DSH session; select/confirm/input/editor await a real `ctx.userQuestions` answer when composed and fail visibly otherwise. Command handlers still return captured `notify` text. Terminal components, themes, and custom controls are unsupported. |
| `mode` | partial | Reports the embedded Pi mode (`rpc` with a decision path, otherwise `print`) rather than a DSH client identity. |
| `hasUI`, `cwd` | supported | `hasUI` dynamically reflects a real DSH decision path (text publication alone is not dialog capability); `cwd` uses the DSH agent working directory. |
| `sessionManager` | partial | A durable Pi session projection is mounted per DSH session under `~/.dsh/pi-sessions/<id>`; native DSH turns are projected into the branch as text entries, and Pi-side appends persist across restart. Images and full model metadata are not projected. |
| `modelRegistry` | partial | `getAll`/`getAvailable`/`find`/`refresh` read a refreshed snapshot of the DSH model catalog (provider/id/name with conservative bounds). Auth status and API keys are not exposed; Pi provider registration still records without creating a DSH adapter. |
| `model` | partial | The current DSH agent selection is projected as provider/id; full Pi `Model` metadata is not synthesized. |
| idle, wait-for-idle, trust, signal, abort, pending messages | supported | Mapped to DSH agent status/settlement, explicit trust config, invocation cancellation, and inbox state. |
| `shutdown` | partial | Cancels the current DSH agent operation without exiting the process. |
| context usage, compact, effective system prompt | unsupported | No faithful projection is wired. |
| command context session controls and reload | unsupported | Pi tree/session mutation and plugin reload do not map to DSH ownership, so calls fail explicitly; prompt options expose cwd only. |

## Events

| Event group | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `session_start` | supported | Per-agent and awaited before the first DSH step; re-emitted after `session_shutdown` on DSH resume/clear/compact. |
| `session_shutdown` | partial | Emitted with the transition reason before each DSH resume/clear/compact restart and drained during teardown; teardown itself is reported with Pi reason `quit`. |
| `input` | partial | `continue`, `handled`, and text/image transform run once for the initial claimed DSH message batch. Text is newline-joined, images are preserved, and a transform replaces the batch with one new DSH message identity. |
| `agent_start`, `turn_start` | supported | Mapped from DSH turn/step boundaries. |
| `agent_settled` | partial | Emitted after `agent_end` at a committed DSH turn end when the inbox has no pending messages; Pi and DSH queue semantics still differ. |
| `agent_end`, `turn_end` | partial | The committed DSH `turn/end` closes the final Pi step and agent run on success, error, or cancellation. Each DSH step gets a paired Pi turn boundary and text history maps; exact Pi provider usage, image replay, and reconstructed `toolResults` do not yet. |
| tool result and execution start/end | supported | Runs around every adapted tool call, including failures and cancellation. |
| tool call | partial | Blocking works; DSH freezes arguments, so Pi handlers cannot reliably mutate input in place. |
| tool execution update | partial | Pi handlers see and finish each `onUpdate` before the terminal event; DSH has no matching tool-owned streaming callback. |
| `before_agent_start` | partial | Handler runs once per agent run, but system-prompt replacement and returned custom messages are not applied yet. |
| `project_trust` | partial | Config is the authoritative trust decision; interactive trust handlers are not run. |
| `resources_discover` | partial | Handlers run, but returned Pi skill/prompt/theme paths are not mounted into DSH registries. |
| session switch/fork/tree/compaction events | unsupported | DSH owns different durable operations and veto contracts. |
| context/message mutation events | unsupported | DSH reconstructs model-visible history from durable events; mutable Pi arrays cannot safely replace it. |
| provider request/header/response events | unsupported | These belong inside a DSH LLM adapter. |
| model/thinking selection and `user_bash` | unsupported | No faithful event boundary is wired yet. |

## Current fixture evidence

The read-only inventory on `/Users/weaxs/Desktop/Workspace/pi` found 17 `packages/pi-*` packages, 11 used API methods, and 18 used events. Representative built-entry smoke tests loaded:

- `pi-image-gen`: `image_generate`, `/image-gen`
- `pi-video-gen`: all four Pi tools load and mount — `video_generate`'s numeric duration bounds pass through to the model-facing schema, `/video-gen`
- `pi-goal`: `/goal`
- `pi-memory`: four tools, including its TypeBox literal-union schemas, `/memory`
- `pi-task-scheduler`: six tools, including its TypeBox literal-union schemas, `/cron`
- `pi-channels`: `notify` with literal-union actions, `/channel`

Two built fixtures fail before the compatibility layer runs:

- `pi-browser-use/dist/index.js` references missing `./analyze-screenshot.js`
- `pi-computer-use/dist/index.js` references missing `./config.js`

Those are stale/incomplete fixture build artifacts. This repository does not rewrite or rebuild the source workspace to hide such failures.

## Next implementation order

1. Map DSH system-prompt assembly to Pi `before_agent_start` and `context` without breaking durable reconstruction.
2. Add a declared DSH projection/event package for durable Pi custom entries and session metadata.
3. Reconstruct full Pi assistant/tool messages from DSH session events for `agent_end` and `turn_end`.
4. Add explicit adapters for DSH provider/request events rather than translating `registerProvider` implicitly.
5. Add optional UI packages for commands/render intents; keep Pi TUI component execution out of the host.
